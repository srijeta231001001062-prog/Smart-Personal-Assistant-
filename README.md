## ✨ What This Assistant Can Do

This AI Smart Assistant understands your natural language commands and performs tasks like:

- 🔍 *Answering questions*  
- ⏰ *Setting reminders*  
- ⛅ *Providing weather updates*  
- 📅 *Managing schedules & tasks*  
- 🤖 *Executing simple automation commands*  
- 🧠 *Interpreting free-form natural language*  
---

## 🧠 How It Works

This project combines:

- *NLP models* to understand what the user wants  
- *Python logic* to interpret intents  
- *APIs* for weather and information lookup  
  

The assistant processes your command → extracts intent → performs the action → returns a clean, friendly response.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2️⃣ Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Run the assistant
bash
Copy code
PyCharm
Open smart_assistant.ipynb and run all cells.

🧪 Example Commands
Try talking to your assistant normally:

arduino
Copy code
"What’s the weather like today?"
"Set a reminder for my exam on Friday at 9 AM."
"Add 'finish project' to my schedule tomorrow."
"Tell me something interesting."
"What's the capital of Italy?"
The assistant understands it — just like a conversation.

🚧 Future Roadmap
✨ Voice input & speech response
✨ Better natural language understanding
✨ A standalone app (web or desktop UI)
✨ Integration with Google Calendar / Notion
✨ Persistent, long-term memory

🌟 Why I Built This
I wanted to explore how real-world AI assistants work — how they interpret commands, understand natural language, and interact with APIs.
This project gave me hands-on experience with NLP, automation logic, and interactive notebook workflows.
